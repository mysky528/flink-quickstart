# State in Flink and Rescaling Stateful Streaming Jobs

## An Intro to Stateful Stream Processing
- At a high level, we can consider state in stream processing as memory in operators
  that remembers information about past input and can be used to influence the processing
  of future input.

- This example should demonstrate that state is a fundamental, enabling concept in stream
  processing that is required for a majority of interesting use cases.
