        rebalance分区方式的图示![avatar](/pic/rebalance.jpg)。
```scala
  /**
   * Sets the partitioning of the DataStream so that the output tuples
   * are broad casted to every parallel instance of the next component.
   */
  def broadcast: DataStream[T] = asScalaStream(stream.broadcast())

  /**
   * Sets the partitioning of the DataStream so that the output values all go to
   * the first instance of the next processing operator. Use this setting with care
   * since it might cause a serious performance bottleneck in the application.
   */
  @PublicEvolving
  def global: DataStream[T] = asScalaStream(stream.global())

  /**
   * Sets the partitioning of the DataStream so that the output tuples
   * are shuffled to the next component.
   */
  @PublicEvolving
  def shuffle: DataStream[T] = asScalaStream(stream.shuffle())

  /**
   * Sets the partitioning of the DataStream so that the output tuples
   * are forwarded to the local subtask of the next component (whenever
   * possible).
   */
  def forward: DataStream[T] = asScalaStream(stream.forward())

  /**
   * Sets the partitioning of the DataStream so that the output tuples
   * are distributed evenly to the next component.
   */
  def rebalance: DataStream[T] = asScalaStream(stream.rebalance())

  /**
   * Sets the partitioning of the [[DataStream]] so that the output tuples
   * are distributed evenly to a subset of instances of the downstream operation.
   *
   * The subset of downstream operations to which the upstream operation sends
   * elements depends on the degree of parallelism of both the upstream and downstream operation.
   * For example, if the upstream operation has parallelism 2 and the downstream operation
   * has parallelism 4, then one upstream operation would distribute elements to two
   * downstream operations while the other upstream operation would distribute to the other
   * two downstream operations. If, on the other hand, the downstream operation has parallelism
   * 2 while the upstream operation has parallelism 4 then two upstream operations will
   * distribute to one downstream operation while the other two upstream operations will
   * distribute to the other downstream operations.
   *
   * In cases where the different parallelisms are not multiples of each other one or several
   * downstream operations will have a differing number of inputs from upstream operations.
